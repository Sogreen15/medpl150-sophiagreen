<p> I am a current Junior in Hunter College studying Journalism, English, and Hebrew. Spending most of my creativity in the literary world, reading novels and writing poetry, but in between the world of words I create posts on Pinterest and curates Spotify playlists. My saves on Pinterest vary between aspirations in life, to iconic pieces of fashion, to my favorite vintage cars. In high school I was in a 2D Art and graphic design class where I created a portfolio based on the concept of ‘If Walls Could Talk.’ Exploring that theme gave me the space to dive into issues I care about; feminism, equality, advocacy, and community. I used mixed media in my pieces, combining graphic design with pages form novels and vinyl records to tell a story and create my own world. I hope to work on my graphic design skills and continue gaining more affordances and outlets to create pieces I care about illustrating topics in society that I care about.</p>
